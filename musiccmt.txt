Mystic Dream ~ Snow or Cherry Petal
No.1 Mystic Dream ~ Snow or Cherry Petal
  Title Screen theme
  The title theme from previous games, done in a Japanese style
  while keeping its essence. This song is meant to belie the
  tense atmosphere of "Now, let the Danmaku begin!". Frankly,
  I think this song isn't necessary, but it's also meant
  to restrain the player's excitement while awaiting Danmaku.

Paradise ~ Deep Mountain
No.2 Paradise ~ Deep Mountain
  Stage 1 theme
  This theme was composed with an image of a natural paradise
  that has yet to be discovered by humans. However, I personally
  didn't want it to be healing music, so I made it somewhat
  rhythmical. Therefore it doesn't have even the slightest
  hint of relaxed feelings (^^;

@bgm/th07_03.mid
Crystallized Silver
No.3 Crystallized Silver
  Stage 1 Boss - Letty Whiterock's theme
  A goal of my music is to blend Japanese and Western elements
  in a non-obvious manner (applies to the other songs too).
  This one is short because it's the theme for the stage 1 boss,
  but I managed to express my image of the realm in this theme.
  While the song is direct, it doesn't fit into any music genre.

The Fantastic Legend of Tohno
No.4 The Fantastic Legend of Tohno
  Stage 2 theme
  This song is a weird one. My original intent with this was to
  make it highly folkish, but since it's too calm it ended up
  half-folkish. I composed this with the image of Tohno village
  in mind. It's a bit nostalgic and makes you imagine that
  there used to be old villages like this in Japan too.

Diao ye zong (Withered Leaf)
No.5 Diao ye zong (Withered Leaf)
  Stage 2 Boss - Chen's theme
  I composed this title with the image of an energetic youkai
  girl in mind. This song is based purely on improvisation,
  because I found that if I think too much while composing the
  music tends to end up strange. Well, with the help of booze...
  All in all, this is an honest song (^^;

@bgm/th07_06.mid
The Doll Maker of Bucuresti
No.6 The Doll Maker of Bucuresti
  Stage 3 theme. This makes you wonder if you're near the end
  of the game. This is because the demo was released very early
  and I had to make it a complete game. Due to that, I put the
  first pivotal moment in stage 3. The mood is more serious than
  usual too. However, the song's similar to what I used to be.
  It might be just me, but this song gives a nostalgic feeling.

Doll Judgment ~ The girl who played with people's shapes
No.7 Doll Judgment ~ The girl who played with people's shapes
  Stage 3 Boss - Alice Margatroid's theme
  Alice is a special character in this series, so I composed the
  theme with renewed vigor (not that I was lazy with the other
  songs). This theme's goal is to show that the characters are
  relaxed despite the intensity of the fight. This exemplifies
  them in my opinion... not the gothic-lolita costumes, I swear.

@bgm/th07_08.mid
The capital city of flowers in the sky
No.8 The capital city of flowers in the sky
  Stage 4 theme. The style is more Chinese than Japanese
  A wonderful place above the clouds. As the true beginning
  of this game, stage 4 is far longer than the others. There's
  never been such a stratospheric (it's not that high) intrusion
  with violent yet sorrowful music has there? While composed
  with "Journey to the West" in mind, it doesn't resemble that.

@bgm/th07_09.mid
Phantom Ensemble
No.9 Phantom Ensemble
  Stage 4 Boss - Prismriver Sisters' theme
  I tried to make this theme sound like it was being performed
  happily and joyfully. A performance by happy-go-lucky sisters
  who love festivals and anything noisy. At the climax, each of
  them play their Violin, Trumpet and Keyboard as they please.
  What a jumble.

@bgm/th07_10.mid
Mystic Oriental Dream ~ Ancient Temple
No.10 Mystic Oriental Dream ~ Ancient Temple
  Stage 5 theme
  This theme expresses the nostalgia that is deep within every
  Japanese and the frantic feeling that arises when someone is
  approaching. The sounds of shinto flutes and bells coming from
  a distance conjure up images of the netherworld.
  Or maybe it's just me?

@bgm/th07_11.mid
Satori Maiden ~ 3rd Eye
No.11 Satori Maiden ~ 3rd Eye
  Stage 5 Boss - Satori Komeiji's Theme
  She's the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits. 
  She's a little fancy and loves animals. 
  Actually, she should be the highest ranked enemy in Subterranean Animism, 
  but it looks like fighting isn't her specialty.
  I tried to make the song dramatic and otherworldly, too.



@bgm/th07_12.mid
Ultimate Truth
No.12 Ultimate Truth
  Stage 6 theme
  The final stage is all about the final boss, so the mid-stage
  is only a token effort. Because of that, this song is rather
  short, but it's also refreshing and pleasant (in my opinion).
  The stage has visual imagery of flying over a sea of cherry
  blossoms; I hope this song will give you the same impression.

Bloom nobly, cherry blossoms of Sumizome ~ Border of Life
No.13 Bloom nobly, cherry blossoms of Sumizome ~ Border of Life
  Stage 6 Boss - Yuyuko Saigyouji's theme
  I gave this theme an oriental and melodious feeling as well as
  a strong determination. Having said that, the style of music
  is my usual fare. Extreme and elegant, powerful but ephemeral;
  I thought I'd make this theme quite emotional.

@bgm/th07_13b.mid
Border of Life
No.14 Border of Life
  Stage 6 Boss - Yuyuko Saigyouji's second theme
  Arranged version of Yuyuko's theme.
  I put more emphasis on the mysterious atmosphere in this one.
  However, the melody itself is so harsh that it's almost
  tiresome.

@bgm/th07_16.mid
Charming Domination
No.15 Charming Domination
  Extra Stage theme
  A high-paced theme (?) which is unusual in the Touhou series.
  It's obvious from the stage that the tempo and enthusiasm are
  the keys to this song. The tone turns around about 112 degrees
  in middle of the song which is where Extra really starts
  (heh).

@bgm/th07_17.mid
A Maiden's Illusionary Funeral ~ Necro-Fantasy
No.16 A Maiden's Illusionary Funeral ~ Necro-Fantasy
  Extra Boss - Ran Yakumo's theme
  I composed it to be more dazzling than fantastic.
  Hopefully you'll get the sense of the energetic youkai from
  the melody. In my opinion, when there's a long fight in a
  shooting game, the music should repeat and sustain its
  tempo. That is, it should be like this theme.

@bgm/th07_18.mid
Charming Domination ~ Who done it?
No.17 Charming Domination ~ Who done it?
  Phantasm Stage theme
  Another version of Charming Domination.
  It's not that different from the original though...

@bgm/th07_19.mid
Necrofantasia
No.18 Necrofantasia
  Phantasm Boss - Yukari Yakumo's theme
  Meant to be an arranged version of Ran's theme, it ended up
  quite different. This one has an ominous feeling. Or rather,
  she's the very embodiment of ominous. Even compared with the
  past characters, she has a devious appearance, a dubious
  character and thoughtless barrages. The theme's just like her.

@bgm/th07_14.mid
Dream of a Spring Breeze
No.19 Dream of a Spring Breeze
  Ending theme
  The ending theme.
  ...hmm, the impression it leaves is so negative.

  It's supposed to be peaceful daily-life, I swear.

@bgm/th07_15.mid
Sakura, Sakura ~ Japanize Dream
No.20 Sakura, Sakura ~ Japanize Dream
  Staff Roll theme
  The imagery is based on the familiar old rhyme "Sakura,
  Sakura". I think this song is kinda refreshing.
